"""Name every pose's chains after one chosen pose, so "interface A-B" means the same thing in all of them.

SUMMARY
    Protenix names duplicate chains arbitrarily: the antigen copy it calls B in one pose can be C in
    the next. Later steps sort poses per interface, so they need one consistent naming across the pool.
    This picks one pose per complex as the reference and expresses every other pose in its terms. No
    native structure is involved.

    WHEN IT DOES ANYTHING -- only when a complex has more than one copy of an entity. With one antibody
    and one antigen there is a single possible assignment (the anchor's A can only match the pose's A,
    the only chain with that sequence), so the mapping is the identity. Of 131 benchmark complexes, 52
    have no duplication, 44 duplicate the antibody, 35 duplicate both; 9jo7 has 5 of each. Over the 73
    multi-interface complexes, 24 never produce a non-identity mapping and 42% of poses get a chain
    renamed.

    WHY THE LABEL MATTERS when the copies are identical -- they share a sequence but not a position, and
    in a given pose the antibody touches one and not the other:

        pose 1: antibody A binds the copy labelled B  ->  (A,B) is a real interface, (A,C) is nothing
        pose 2: antibody A binds the copy labelled C  ->  (A,C) is a real interface, (A,B) is nothing

    Ranking by "ipTM at A-B" then compares pose 1's docking site against a pair of chains in pose 2 that
    never touch, and pose-pose DockQ at A-B makes two identically-docked poses look unrelated.

    ONE ANCHOR PER COMPLEX, not per interface. The mapping pairs each anchor chain with exactly one pose
    chain and no two share a partner, so the anchor's (A,B) and (A,C) necessarily land on different chain
    pairs of the pose. Two independent per-interface mappings could both pick the pose's (A,B) pair,
    putting one physical interface into two candidate lists.

INPUTS
    --out-dir: where to write the two csvs. Required.
    --pdbs:    comma-separated subset of complexes. Default: every complex in the pool csv.
    --jobs:    how many worker processes map poses in parallel. Default 8. CPU only; each process reads
               one pose cif at a time, so this is bounded by disk and cores, not by GPU.

    Files read, none of them arguments:
    pool csv:      paths.PXM2025_POOL_CSV -- pair_iptm per pose per interface, used to pick the anchor
    pose cifs:     via paths.pool_pose(), read by the chain mapper
    crystal files: the reference roles and mappings, used ONLY to decide which of the anchor's chain
                   pairs is called "8w5d_AB", so the output lines up against the crystal-framed run

OUTPUTS
    <out-dir>/chain_maps_anchor.csv:  per pose, {anchor_chain: pose_chain}
    <out-dir>/chain_roles_anchor.csv: per interface, which ANCHOR chains are the antibody and antigen

    Both are drop-in for build_matrices.py --maps/--roles.

EXAMPLE
    anchor_relabel.py --out-dir anchor_merged --jobs 8
    anchor_relabel.py --out-dir /tmp/try --pdbs 8w5d,8w5f --jobs 4

FUNCTIONS
    pool_rows():     pool csv -> {pdb: {(seed, sample): {interface: pair_iptm}}}
    pick_anchor():   the poses of one complex -> the (seed, sample) to use as reference
    map_to_anchor(): one pose -> its chain mapping onto the anchor, as a csv row
    anchor_roles():  the anchor's chain pair per interface, for the roles csv
    main():          pick an anchor per complex, map every pose, write both csvs
