"""Queue the top-5-pose self-templating experiment: oracle templates versus confident templates.

THE COMPARISON. For each interface take its 5 best poses two ways -- by ground-truth DockQ (oracle)
and by ipTM (what a user could actually pick) -- and self-template on each set. The oracle arm is an
UPPER BOUND, not a method: it answers "if we could identify the good poses, would self-templating
exploit them?" If it does not beat the confidence arm, no amount of better clustering helps, because
clustering can at best find what the oracle already had.

The two sets are nearly disjoint and that is the point: on 87 of 91 decoy interfaces they share ZERO
poses, and the oracle set averages DockQ 0.369 against the confidence set's 0.061.

Emits fold.py's queue format, which takes explicit pose paths:

    all5  <pdb>  <interface>  <tag>  <seed>  <pose1> ... <pose5>

`all5` means "these N poses are one template set, averaged by TemplateEmbedder" -- it does NOT
require them to come from one seed, despite the name.

FRESH SEEDS (400000+) so nothing collides with the pool's 300000-300049 run directories.

    "self-templating helps more when ipTM is low" explains that without pose quality mattering at all.
