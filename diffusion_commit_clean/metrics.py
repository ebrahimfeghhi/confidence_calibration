"""Three ways to measure how similar two poses of the same complex are.

WHY THREE. We want to cluster 250 poses into basins and self-template each basin, so the clustering
metric decides what a "basin" is. Three candidates, and the right one is an empirical question:

    epitope   which ANTIGEN RESIDUES the antibody touches            (a patch)
    fcc       which ANTIBODY-ANTIGEN RESIDUE PAIRS are in contact    (a patch AND a register)
    dockq     the CAPRI measure, computed pose against pose          (the field standard)

They differ in a way we have already been bitten by: two poses can touch the same antigen patch from
opposite directions. Epitope overlap calls those identical; FCC does not, because the pairs differ.
Measured earlier on 250 poses, epitope-Jaccard-to-truth in 0.4-0.6 was LESS often acceptable (9/65)
than 0.2-0.3 (15/18), and it traced to one interface whose poses shared the surface with the wrong
register -- exactly the failure epitope-only similarity cannot see. A 5-pose smoke test on 9s36_AB
showed the same split: one pose shared 11-27% of antigen residues with the other four but had FCC
0.000 against all of them, and pose-pose DockQ agreed with FCC (0.07-0.12), not with epitope Jaccard.

CUTOFFS follow the conventions we would be compared against:
    epitope   4.5 A heavy atom, the SAbDab/AsEP convention
    fcc       5.0 A heavy atom residue-residue pairs, the CAPRI/HADDOCK convention

FCC IS SYMMETRISED HERE. Rodrigues et al. define it as |A and B| / |A|, normalised by the reference,
so FCC(a,b) != FCC(b,a). Clustering needs a symmetric distance, so this returns the Jaccard form
|A and B| / |A or B| over contact pairs. Noted because the asymmetric number is what the FCC papers
report, and the two are not interchangeable.

EVERY FUNCTION TAKES ONE CHAIN PAIR PER POSE, never a single pair for the whole set. On a multi-copy
assembly the model builds several antigen copies and different poses bind different ones -- 23 of 40
8w5d poses are permuted relative to the reference -- so a fixed pair silently compares different
molecules. chain_map.py backfills the per-pose mapping (see its docstring for why it must be anchored
to the ground truth rather than pose-to-pose); items_for_interface() below turns that into the
per-pose chain pairs these functions expect. This mirrors dockq_torch, which has always taken the
pair as an argument for the same reason.

TWO VENVS. The metric functions need torch (Protenix venv); chain_map.py needs pxmeter. Imports here
are lazy so this module loads under either.
