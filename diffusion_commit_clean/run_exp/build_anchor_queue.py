"""Anchor-frame donor queue, reusing every fold the crystal-frame sweep already produced.

WHAT CHANGES FROM build_complex_queue.py. Only the frame. Selection is the same algorithm -- per
interface, order by pair_iptm, keep a pose whose pose-pose DockQ to everything kept is below 0.23,
round-robin the per-interface lists into one per-complex set, cap 50. What differs is that the pose-pose
DockQ and the chain pinning come from matrices built against the complex's highest-mean-ipTM POSE
instead of against the crystal, so nothing in the selection path consults the native structure.

REUSE IS KEYED ON (donor pose, seed, pinned chains), NOT ON THE TAG. A fold's output is determined by
the pose it templated, the seed, and which chains of that pose were pinned. The tag is just a name, and
naming was already load-bearing once by accident: sibling interfaces sharing tag K00 silently swapped
donors. Measured here: 728 anchor donors are poses the crystal frame ALSO chose but pinned to a
different antigen copy. Those are different templates and must be refolded; reusing them on pose+seed
alone would substitute one fold for another that never ran.

CARRIED ROWS ARE REWRITTEN, NOT COPIED. The old csv recorded donor_pose="-1", so a carried row would
arrive with no provenance and the reuse rule could not be applied to it a second time. Each carried row
is re-emitted under its NEW tag with the pose and chains filled in, and a claim directory is created so
a worker treats it as already done instead of refolding it.
