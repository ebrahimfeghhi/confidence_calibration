"""Run provenance: a stable id, a run-scoped output directory, and a run.json per fold.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Folds are not reproducible run-to-run (bf16 reductions reorder; the same seed has
landed at DockQ 0.03 and 0.59 on the same card), so a repeat fold of a seed is DATA, not a duplicate
-- it must not overwrite the first. Every fold therefore gets its own directory keyed by a hash of
the inputs that define it, plus a run.json recording enough to tell two runs of the same seed apart
after the fact: precision, recycle count, which poses were used as templates and their checksums.

The pxm2025 pool was written without any of this, and its exact configuration is now unrecoverable --
we cannot tell from disk whether it was bf16 or fp32, or what templates it saw. That is the failure
this module is meant to prevent repeating.

The id deliberately mixes a timestamp, the pid and a content hash: the hash makes an identical
re-request collapse onto one directory, while the timestamp and pid keep two concurrent workers on
the same arm from colliding.

    The seed is in the NAME so `ls` is useful (which seeds are done, which are missing), and in

    The experiment name is the caller's --out, so the old <mode> level is gone: "periodic_2_5_8" as
    an experiment name says more than "free" did as a mode. Its absence also fixed a real accident --
    passing --out <tree>/free while the mode was also "free" produced <tree>/free/free/<pdb>/...

    NO INTERFACE LEVEL. Every fold produces the WHOLE complex, whatever it was aimed at, so an
    interface in the path is misleading: it suggests the output is specific to one interface when the
    coordinates cover all of them. Which interface motivated a templated arm, and which poses were
    used, live in run.json instead -- metadata, not directory structure. The earlier shape also
    invited a silent error: the old driver passed pdb into the interface slot, so pool folds landed
    at <pdb>/<pdb>/ while the new one wrote <pdb>/all/, two shapes for one kind of fold."""
