"""Can a DIVERSITY shortlist put a good seed in the top 10, where ipTM manages only 44%?

THE PROBLEM. On 91 confident decoys that do contain an acceptable pose somewhere in their 50 seeds,
ranking seeds by ipTM puts a good seed in the top 10 just 44% of the time, and in the top 1 only 5%.
That is because the most confident seeds are the same dominant wrong basin over and over -- ranking by
confidence selects for agreement with the majority answer, which is exactly the failure mode.

THE IDEA. Shortlist for COVERAGE instead of confidence: cluster the seeds by which antigen surface
they bind, and take one representative per cluster. If 250 poses occupy only a handful of basins, ten
leaders should cover nearly all of them.

WHY EPITOPE SETS AND NOT POSE-POSE DockQ. DockQ between every pair of 250 poses is 31k OST calls per
interface, hours each. Two earlier results make the epitope a good stand-in: across 250 poses the
folds and interface patches are essentially identical (lDDT SD 0.007, patch RMSD 0.10 A) so only the
docking SITE moves; and the epitope explains 82% of the DockQ gain from seed scaling. So clustering on
"which antigen residues are contacted" should recover the same basins at O(n) cost instead of O(n^2).

LABEL-FREE. The epitope of a POSE is computed from the pose itself -- antigen residues within 5 A of
antibody. Nothing here reads the native structure or any DockQ. That matters: epitope_overlap_pxm.csv
holds overlap WITH THE NATIVE, and using it would leak the answer into the shortlist.

Usage: epitope_leader.py --n 15 [--thresh 0.5] [--k 10]
